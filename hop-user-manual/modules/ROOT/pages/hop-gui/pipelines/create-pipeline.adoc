= Create a Pipeline

TODO: this content is based on the https://www.project-hop.org/manual/latest/getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide]. Elaborate more.

Create a new pipeline through the https://www.project-hop.org/manual/latest/hop-gui/workitems.html[New Work Item] dialog. You'll be presented with the dialog shown below.

Pipelines consist of transforms connected by hops. In short, a pipeline is a parallel processing operation of your data.
A transform is one small step in your data processing. Combined, all of these steps (or transforms) turn your pipelines in one giant leap of data processing.

== Concepts
Pipelines consist of two main work items:

* **transforms** are the basic operations in your pipeline. A pipeline typically consists of a lot of transforms that are chained together by hops.
Transforms are granular, in the sense that each transform is designed and optimized to perform one and only one task. Although one transform by itself may not offer spectacular functionality, the combination of all transforms in a pipeline is makes your pipelines powerful.

* **hops** link transforms together. When a transform finishes processing the data set it received, that data set is passed to the next transform through a hop.
Hops are uni-directional (data can't flow backwards). Hops only buffer and pass data around, the hop itself is transform-agnostic, it doesn't know anything about the transforms it passes data from or to.
Some transforms can read from or write to other transforms conditionally to or from a number of other transforms, but this a transform-specific configuration. The hop is unaware of it.
Hops can be disabled by clicking on them, or through right-click -> disable.

== Add Transform to your pipelines

Click anywhere in the pipeline canvas, the area where you'll see the image below.

Upon clicking, you'll be presented with the dialog shown below. The search box at the top of this dialog works for transform, name, tags (TODO) etc.
Once you've found the transform you're looking for, click on it to add it to your pipeline. An alternative to clicking is arrow key navigation + enter.
Repeat this step now or whenever you want to add more transforms to your pipeline.
Once you've added a transform to your pipeline, you can drag to reposition it.

Check the https://www.project-hop.org/manual/latest/plugins/transforms.html[list] of transforms to add to your pipeline for more details.

Add a 'Generate Rows' and a 'Add Sequence' transform, and your pipeline should like the one below.

==== Add a Hop

There are a number of ways to create a hop:

* shift-drag: while holding down the shift key on your keyboard. Click on a transform, while holding down your primary mouse button, drag to the second transform. Release the primary mouse button and the shift key.
* scroll-drag: scroll-click on a transform , while holding down your mouse's scroll button, drag to the second transform. Release the scroll button.
* click on a transform in your pipeline to open the 'click anywhere' dialog. Click the 'Create hop' image::getting-started/icons/HOP.svg[Create hop, 25px, align="bottom"] button and select the transform you want to create the hop to.
