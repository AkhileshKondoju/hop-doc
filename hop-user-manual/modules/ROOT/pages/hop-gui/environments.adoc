== Managing Environments

NOTE: the current environments implementation is assumed to be functional and feature complete for Hop version 1.0. However, we still intend to work on UI improvements as documented in https://project-hop.atlassian.net/browse/HOP-378[HOP-378]. We encourage the community to provide feedback in that ticket.

=== What are Hop Environments

Most people who design and manage data processing on a daily basis work on a multitude of project and modules.
You'll need to manage these different sets of workflows and pipelines in at least your development, acceptance production environments.
Each of these environments comes with its own set of variables and configurations for databases, file paths etc.

The Hop Environments allow data developers to manage these different environments with their configurations and variables.
Each environment will remember your opened files, their zoom level and other UI settings.

=== Create an Environment

To create a new environment, hit the 'New' button or CTRL-N. From the pop-up dialog, click the 'Environment' icon: image:hop-gui/environment/environment.svg[Environment]

The dialog below will show up.

Let's walk through the options in this dialog:

.Environment Properties
[id="tab-env-props", cols="20%,45%,5%,5%,25%", option="header]
|===
|Property|Description|Variables Supported|Mandatory|Default
|Name|The environment's name. Environments will be listed in alphabetical order. Take this into account when naming your environments.|No|Yes|
|Description|A description for this environment|No|No|
|Company|The company this environment belongs to|No|No|
|Department|The department this environment is created for|No|No|
|Project|The project this environment is created for|No|No|
|Version|This project version. The project version will become more meaningful once we implement git integration.|No|No|
|Environment base folder|The base folder to use for this environment|Yes|Yes|
|MetaStore base folder|The folder where this environment's metadata will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}
|Unit test base path|The folder where this environment's unit tests will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}
|Data Sets CSV Folder|The folder where this environment's data files will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/datasets
|Enforce execution in environment home||Yes|Yes|checked
|System variables to set|A list of variable names, values and variable descriptions to use with this environment|No|Yes|
|===

After creating an environment, you'll be asked if you want to switch to your new environment.
If you choose to do so, all options and variables will be applied.

=== Switch Environments

To switch from one environment to another, use the environment list from the main Hop Gui toolbar.

After switching to an environment, Hop Gui will show the exact status of that environment since you last used it. All open files will be restored, including their zoom level and other UI settings.

=== Manage Environments

To edit an existing environment, choose 'Edit Metastore Element' from the file menu.

The environment dialog will be opened, where you'll be able to change all settings as described in <<tab-env-props>>.

=== Advanced Environment Management

==== Environment Files

By default, environments are stored in your Hop folder as XML files in the path `config/environments/metastore/Hop Environment/`

Set your system's environment `HOP_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` to overrule the default folder with your custom location.

Although very rarely required, these XML files can be modified by hand or generated and managed through scripts.

==== Hop Environment Configuration

Hop Conf is a command line tool to manage your environments.

Run the `hop-conf.sh` script with the `-h` flag to display the available options: `./hop-conf.sh -h`.
