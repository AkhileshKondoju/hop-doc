== Managing Environments

=== What are Hop Environments

Most people who design and manage data processing on a daily basis work on a multitude of project and modules.
You'll need to manage these different sets of workflows and pipelines in at least your development, acceptance and production environments.
Every environment comes with its own set of variables and configurations for databases, file paths etc.

The Hop Environments allow data developers to manage these different environments with their configurations and variables.
Each environment will remember your opened files, their zoom level and other UI settings.

=== Create an Environment

To create a new environment you can use the "Add a new environment" button.

You will then be asked for a name:

After specifying a name for the environment you can pick the folder in which it lives.

After that the environment is added to the list in the main hop configuration file (config.json).
We can now edit the environment details:

Let's walk through the options in this dialog:

.Environment Properties
[id="tab-env-props", cols="20%,45%,5%,5%,25%", option="header]
|===
|Property|Description|Variables Supported|Mandatory|Default
|Description|A description for this environment|No|No|
|Company|The company this environment belongs to|No|No|
|Department|The department this environment is created for|No|No|
|Project|The project this environment is created for|No|No|
|Version|This project version. The project version will become more meaningful once we implement git integration.|No|No|
|Metadata base folder|The folder where this environment's metadata will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/metadata
|Unit test base path|The folder where this environment's unit tests will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}
|Data Sets CSV Folder|The folder where this environment's data files will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/datasets
|Enforce execution in environment home|Give an error when trying to execute a pipeline or workflow which is not located in the environment home directory or in a sub-directory|Yes|Yes|checked
|System variables to set|A list of variable names, values and variable descriptions to use with this environment|No|Yes|
|===

After creating an environment, the user interface will switch to it.  If you specified any variables they will now be available when working.

=== Switch Environments

To switch from one environment to another, use the environment list from the main Hop Gui toolbar.

After switching to an environment, Hop Gui will show the exact status of that environment since you last used it. All open files will be restored, including their zoom level and other UI settings.

=== Manage Environments

To edit an existing environment, choose the 'Edit environment' toolbar icon:

The environment dialog will be opened, where you'll be able to change all settings as described in <<tab-env-props>>.

To delete an environment you can use the 'Delete Environment' toolbar icon:

=== Advanced Environment Management

==== Environment Files

Hop enviroments and their home folders are stored in the hop configuration file 'config.json'.  That file lives by default in the config/ folder of your Hop installation.  However, you can point to a different folder with the system property: 'HOP_CONFIG_DIRECTORY'.

In that file you will see a section called 'environmentConfig' containing something like the following:

[source,json]
{
 "environmentConfig" : {
  "enabled" : true,
  "openingLastEnvironmentAtStartup" : true,
  "environmentConfigFilename" : "environment.json",
  "environmentFolders" : {
   "Project 1 - DEV" : "/projects/one/dev/",
   "Project 1 - UAT" : "/projects/one/uat/",
   "Project 1 - PRD" : "/projects/one/prd/",
   "Project 2 - DEV" : "/projects/two/dev/",
   "Project 2 - UAT" : "/projects/two/uat/",
   "Project 2 - PRD" : "/projects/two/prd/",
  }
}


==== Hop Environment Configuration

Hop Conf is a command line tool to manage your environments.

Run the `hop-conf.sh` script with the `-h` flag to display the available options: `./hop-conf.sh -h`.
